# Hospital-Billing-System
Used PostgreSql to create and maintain the                                  database for hospital billing system. Here we did                                  not create a frontend for our application.                                 We showed the database connectivity and                                  implemented Insertion, Deletion and Updation                                  on database from programming environment.                                  The main aim of this project was to be able to                                  use JDBC API to execute the PostgreSQL                                  Queries.
